# WishList-for-Cars-Usng-Angular
The target of this  project is to

- Create a WishList for Cars with add//remove features using Angular
- Create an interface that lets me choose a car model from a select box to be added to a "wish list". 
  The list only needs to exist in memory and any saving functionality (localstorage, cookies, etc) is out of scope. 
  
  The key behaviors are explained below-

    1. Cars in the select box should be displayed alphabetically (grouped by make)
    2. After being added to the wish list, a car should no longer be available for selection.
    3. After a car has been added to the wish list, the select box should default to the first alphabetically 
      available car from the same make 
      (unless all cars from that make have been selected - in which case the first available car in the list should be 
      suggested)
    4. There should be some mechanism to remove a car from the wish list (thus making it selectable once more)
